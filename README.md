Hi 👋 My name is Purity Usiemwanta
==================================

<!-- I'm a Frontend Web Developer
---------------------------- -->

I'm a web developer and operations lead based in Nigeria, passionate about building intuitive digital products and supporting people-centered projects. As the **Lead Front-End Developer and Head of Operations at Credevnet Technologies**, I combine technical expertise with operational strategy to help propel the team to new heights.

💻 **What I Do**  
- **Front-End Developer**: Specializing in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **React**, **ASP.NET Core**, **Bootstrap**, and **Tailwind**, I craft responsive, engaging, and accessible web experiences.
- **Operations Leader**: As Head of Operations, I streamline processes and coordinate across teams to bring our projects to life.
- **Co-founder of Zeqah**: Our support hub for university students fosters growth and offers guidance through programs focused on careers, study, onboarding, and training.

🌱 **On the Journey**  
With a strong interest in **project management**, I’m continually exploring ways to blend my love for people management and business into impactful leadership. I’m also enhancing my technical expertise in **React** and **ASP.NET Core** and delving into **internet architecture** for a deeper understanding of backend systems.

🎶 **Beyond Work**  
Outside the office, you’ll find me **singing**, experimenting with new **perfume blends**, or enjoying some good bolé (grilled plantain...you should try it out 😉). I’m driven by a love for creativity, business, and community, which fuels much of my work and passions.
